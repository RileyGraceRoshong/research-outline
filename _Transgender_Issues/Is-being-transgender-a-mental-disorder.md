Issue: Is being transgender a mental disorder?

Rule(s): 

    According to the American Psychological Association, “a psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.” https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender

    Additionally, according to the Endocrine Society, “there is evolving consensus that being transgender is not a mental health disorder. Such evidence stems from scientific studies suggesting that: 1) attempts to change gender identity in intersex patients to match external genitalia or chromosomes are typically unsuccessful; 2) identical twins (who share the exact same genetic background) are more likely to both experience transgender identity as compared to fraternal (non-identical) twins; 3) among individuals with female chromosomes (XX), rates of male gender identity are higher for those exposed to higher levels of androgens in utero relative to those without such exposure, and male (XY)-chromosome individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome typically have female gender identity; and 4) there are associations of certain brain scan or staining patterns with gender identity rather than external genitalia or chromosomes.” https://www.endocrine.org/advocacy/position-statements/transgender-health#1

    Additionally, in 2019, the World Health Organization stopped classifying transgender people as having a mental disorder. https://time.com/5596845/world-health-organization-transgender-identity/

Analysis:

    Being transgender does not inherently mean that one may experience significant distress or disability and causes for experiencing that is often related to societal issues. Furthermore, it is not classified as a mental disorder by the WHO. 

Conclusion: Being transgender is not a mental disorder.
